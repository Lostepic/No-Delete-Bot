# No-Delete-Bot

No Delete is my first entry into making a bot, it is simple and pretty dumb but this is my first.

The bot will respond to the following:

"Hi bot" Bot responce: "@sender Hello, I am No Delete"
"Who made the bot" Bot responce: "This bot was created by Aaran#0001"

The bot is made to tag a user and tell them off if they remove a message, the warning can be changed by editing "index.js" and editing the line 13:
"msg.reply("Please do not delete your messages");" only edit the message.

You must rename ".env.example" to ".env" and then edit this file and add in your discord bot token

My very first bot, thank you for looking!
